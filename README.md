This short project was created by Seth Vogt, an Auburn Graduate Student, for a class assignment.
Hey Day is a tradition at Auburn that came around shortly after the Second World War, where students
were encouraged to say "Hey" to returning veterans at the university. The tradition has stuck around
for many years after as a good way to meet new people and remain friendly to those on campus.

This short program simply asks a user their name, stored as a variable called "name", and repeats it
to them while wishing them a Happy Hey Day!

#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user to enter their name
echo "Hello there! What's your name?"
read name

# Personalized greeting
echo "Hey, $name! ðŸ‘‹  Happy Hey-Day! ðŸ¦…  War Eagle!"
echo "I hope you're ready to have an awesome day at Auburn! ðŸš€"
